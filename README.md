# Steps
## Getting Started - create shell/starter files
1.  create a new, empty directory
1.  use notepad or similar to create a plain text file named ```index.html```. **Be very careful** to not accidentally save it as ```index.html.txt``` which is the default action in Windows Notepad. 
1.  enter the text you see inside __**starter04.txt**__
1. open your ```index.html``` in a browser.  This can usually be done by locating the file in Windows Explorer, right-click, choose ```open with ...``` and pick one of the browsers offered.
1. Use Notepad to create a new file named ```styles.css``` __in the same directory as__ ```index.html```.  Add the following line to ```styles.css```:
   ```HTML
   /* future styles go in here */
   ```
   Save the file.
1. Open up ```index.html``` and add the following line just below the ```<title>``` line:
   ```HTML
   <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```
1. Open ```index.html``` and add the following line between ```html <head>``` and ```html </head>```:
   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```
   Save the file.
1. Refresh the browser that you previously opened to see the change.
